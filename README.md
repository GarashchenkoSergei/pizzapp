## What is this?
Just a little demo of the pizza ordering application.  
You can add to cart, remove from cart, login to check orders history. Doesn't have any servers connected, so all content is hardcoded.

## Libraries used
-React,  
-React-router-dom,  
-React-redux for state handling,  
-Redux-saga for sideffects (there are no requests to servers at the moment, saga can be easily rewritten to fetch data from servers),  
-Axios (was not used, but might be handy later),  
-Redux-actions for actions creating.

## Things to do later (hopefully but not likely):
-Divide into smaller components,  
-Add forms handling and validation,  
-Add 'Sign Up' section on the user page,  
-Change the way styles are organized,  
-Add propTypes,  
-Add tests,  
-Change mobile layout,  
-Component refactoring.

## Available Scripts
### `yarn start`
### `yarn build`
